Chapter 2 introduces Euterpea more formally.

A chunk of it involves walking through the public interface of the
Euterpea library, which can be found 
[on github](https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea2/blob/master/Euterpea/Music.lhs).

The code in this directory is mostly just exercise solutions (Chapter 2
is the first one with exercises)
